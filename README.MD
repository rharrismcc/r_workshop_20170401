These are the files for the presentations given at the "R Meetup Group Workshop" on April 1, 2017.

I had to delete the first GITHUB repository, and re-create it, in order to upload the videos.

The simplest thing for everyone to do is just completely delete your original local subdirectory, and re-clone this using:

git   clone   https://github.com/rharrismcc/r_workshop_20170401.git
